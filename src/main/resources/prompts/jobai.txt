When assessing automation risk, consider these factors:

HIGHER RISK indicators:
- Repetitive, rule-based tasks
- Data processing and pattern matching
- Predictable physical labor
- Tasks with clear inputs and outputs
- Limited need for emotional intelligence
- Minimal creative judgment required

LOWER RISK indicators:
- Complex human interaction and empathy
- Novel problem-solving and creativity
- Physical dexterity in unpredictable environments
- Strategic decision-making with incomplete information
- Deep domain expertise combined with judgment
- Ethical reasoning and accountability requirements

0.0 – 2.9   | Low        | Role likely to be augmented, not replaced; core functions require human judgment
3.0 – 6.9   | Moderate   | Significant task automation possible; role will transform substantially
7.0 – 10.0  | High       | Most core functions automatable; role faces potential displacement
